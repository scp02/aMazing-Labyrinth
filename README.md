# aMazing-Labyrinth
Our electronic version of the board game, Ravensburger Labyrinth.

Objective: Be the first to collect all of your treasures by shifting the walls of the Labyrinth to create a clear path to get to them. 

**How to play:**
Start by choosing a number of treasure cards for each player. Fewer cards means for a quicker game.

The board has a fixed set of static tiles printed. The other tiles are randomly placed to create the labyrinth. These slide in and out of the rows and columns created by the static tiles. There are 49 tiles on the board at any given time and 1 tile outside. Players take turns sliding this extra free tile into a row or column, sliding all those tiles and pushing out another free tile. Players move around the shifting paths of the labyrinth in a race to collect various treasures. Whoever collects all of his treasures first and returns to his home space wins!
